- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB RSS
- **Cross-platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows

## 🔗 Key Interfaces

### Critical Data Flow Paths
```rust
// Hot path: Input → Core → Render
Input → process_keystroke() → LiveMetrics → render_frame()

// Content generation
ContentManager → generate() → TextContent → validate()

// Performance monitoring
PerformanceMonitor → record_latency() → meets_targets()
```

### Shared Types
All components use consistent types from `core/src/types.rs`:
- `SessionState`, `SessionResult`, `LiveMetrics`
- `LevelId`, `TrainingMode`, `UserProgress`
- `PerformanceMetrics`, `CentotypeError`

## 🛠️ Implementation Readiness

### Parallel Development Streams

The architecture enables **4 independent development streams**:

1. **Core + Engine** (Senior Rust Developer)
   - Implement session management and scoring engine
   - Build input processing and render loop
   - Focus on performance optimization

2. **Content + Analytics** (Content Specialist + Developer)
   - Create text corpus and generation algorithms
   - Build difficulty analysis and user analytics
   - Focus on data quality and insights

3. **CLI + Persistence** (Frontend/CLI Developer)
   - Implement command interface and navigation
   - Build configuration and profile storage
   - Focus on user experience

4. **Platform Integration** (Systems Engineer)
   - Complete OS-specific optimizations
   - Implement terminal compatibility
   - Focus on cross-platform reliability

### Development Priority Order

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
1. Core session management (`SessionManager`)
2. Input processing pipeline (`InputProcessor`)
3. Basic content generation (`ContentGenerator`)
4. Platform detection and validation

**Week 3-4: Integration**
1. Engine + Core integration with performance validation
2. Content + Analytics pipeline
3. CLI interface with persistence
4. Cross-platform testing

**Week 5-6: Polish**
1. Performance optimization and tuning
2. Error handling and recovery
3. User interface refinement
4. Documentation and testing
