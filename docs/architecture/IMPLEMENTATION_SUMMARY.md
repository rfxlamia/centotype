# Stable Event Contracts and Trait Boundaries Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of frozen event contracts and trait boundaries for Centotype's coordinated development. All interfaces are now stable and ready for parallel development across teams.

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### Event System Contracts (`core/src/events.rs`)

**Frozen GameEvent enum with all variants:**
- ✅ `KeyIn` - User input events with timing and modifiers
- ✅ `Hit` - Successful character matches
- ✅ `Miss` - Typing errors with classification (Substitution/Insertion/Deletion/Transposition)
- ✅ `Tick` - Regular timing updates for live metrics
- ✅ `Render` - Frame update events with component info
- ✅ `SessionComplete` - Session finalization with results
- ✅ `Quit` - Emergency quit with reason classification
- ✅ `Pause` - Session pause/resume events
- ✅ `LevelChange` - Level transition events

**Error Classification System:**
- ✅ `ErrorType` enum with Damerau-Levenshtein error types
- ✅ Weighted scoring (Transposition: 3.0, Substitution: 2.0, Insertion/Deletion: 1.0)
- ✅ Practice recommendations per error type
- ✅ Human-readable descriptions

**Performance Optimizations:**
- ✅ Serializable event format (no Instant/crossterm dependencies)
- ✅ Event batching for high-frequency scenarios
- ✅ Priority-based processing (urgent events: 255, input: 128, general: 64)
- ✅ Performance metrics with P99 targets (<5ms event processing)

### Core Trait Boundaries (`core/src/traits.rs`)

**✅ ScoringEngine trait (Core ↔ Engine)**
- `process_keystroke()` - P99 <5ms, hot path with no heap allocations
- `current_state()` - P99 <1ms, read-only access
- `complete_session()` - Session finalization with full metrics
- `get_live_metrics()` - Real-time WPM/accuracy calculations
- `classify_error()` - Damerau-Levenshtein error detection

**✅ ContentLoader trait (Engine ↔ Content)**
- `load_level_content()` - P99 <25ms including generation
- `get_cached_content()` - P99 <5ms cache-only lookup
- `preload_next_levels()` - Non-blocking background preloading
- `validate_content_difficulty()` - Quality assurance checks
- Target: >90% cache hit rate

**✅ AnalyticsCollector trait (Engine ↔ Analytics)**
- `record_keystroke()` - P99 <1ms, async non-blocking
- `calculate_wpm()` / `calculate_accuracy()` - Fast live calculations
- `get_error_distribution()` - Educational feedback data
- `get_rhythm_analysis()` - Advanced timing pattern analysis
- No impact on critical path performance

**✅ SessionPersistence trait (Engine ↔ Persistence)**
- `save_session()` - 1-2 seconds acceptable, atomic writes
- `load_profile()` - P95 <500ms with full user data
- `update_progress()` - P99 <100ms, atomic level progression
- `backup_user_data()` - Background data safety operations

**✅ TerminalManager trait (Engine ↔ Platform)**
- `poll_event()` - P99 <10ms, core input handling
- `enter_raw_mode()` / `leave_raw_mode()` - P95 <50ms, synchronous
- `emergency_cleanup()` - Synchronous, never fails (panic handler)
- `apply_optimizations()` - One-time platform-specific tuning

### Data Flow Architecture (`docs/architecture/ADR-001-data-flow.md`)

**✅ Established Flow Pattern:**
```
content/ → core/ → engine/ → cli/ (main execution path)
analytics/ ← engine/ (side effects, non-blocking)
persistence/ ← engine/ (async, non-blocking)
platform/ ↔ engine/ (bidirectional, low-level)
```

**✅ Performance Boundaries:**
- content/ → core/: <5ms content lookup (cache hit)
- core/ → engine/: <5ms scoring calculation
- engine/ → cli/: <15ms render update
- **Total input-to-visual: <25ms P99**

**✅ Arc Usage Pattern:**
- All shared data uses `Arc<T>` to minimize clone overhead
- Clone the Arc, not the contained data
- Memory target: <50MB total application usage

## Coordination Benefits

### ✅ Parallel Development Enabled
- **rust-pro**: Can implement engine using `ScoringEngine` and `TerminalManager` traits
- **ui-ux-designer**: Can implement CLI using `GameEvent` system and render traits
- **performance-engineer**: Can optimize individual crate implementations independently

### ✅ Performance Guarantees
- All interfaces have measurable performance targets
- Benchmark suite validates each boundary
- P99 latencies defined for critical path operations
- Memory usage constraints established

### ✅ Interface Stability
- **FROZEN CONTRACT**: All traits and events locked for Week 3-4
- Breaking changes require ADR revision and team coordination
- Mock implementations available for testing during development

## Testing and Validation

### ✅ Compilation Status
- All workspace crates compile successfully
- Core event system fully functional
- Trait boundaries properly defined with async-trait support
- Serialization/deserialization working for persistent events

### ✅ Performance Framework
- Event processing metrics with P99 tracking
- Performance validation methods in each trait
- Benchmark integration points defined
- Memory usage monitoring capabilities

### ✅ Error Handling
- Consistent `Result<T, CentotypeError>` pattern across all traits
- Error classification system with educational feedback
- Graceful degradation patterns defined
- Emergency cleanup procedures established

## Development Workflow

### ✅ Mock Implementation Strategy
Each crate can implement mock versions of their traits:

```rust
// Example: Mock scoring engine for engine development
pub struct MockScoringEngine {
    // Minimal state for realistic performance simulation
}

#[async_trait]
impl ScoringEngine for MockScoringEngine {
    async fn process_keystroke(&mut self, key: KeyCode, timestamp: Instant) -> Result<ScoringResult> {
        // Fast mock with realistic timing
        Ok(ScoringResult::mock_correct_keystroke())
    }
}
```

### ✅ Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Validate each interface meets performance targets
cargo bench --bench input_latency_benchmark     # Platform → Engine
cargo bench --bench content_performance_benchmark # Content → Core
cargo bench --bench scoring_performance_benchmark # Core → Engine
cargo bench --bench end_to_end_latency_benchmark # Total system
```

### ✅ Integration Testing
- Event flow validation across crate boundaries
- Performance regression detection
- Interface compliance verification
- Mock-to-real implementation migration testing

## Next Steps for Development Teams

### rust-pro (Engine Implementation)
1. Implement `CentotypeEngine` using stable trait interfaces
2. Use mock implementations for `ScoringEngine` and `ContentLoader` initially
3. Focus on event processing loop and performance optimization
4. Validate against P99 <25ms end-to-end latency target

### ui-ux-designer (CLI Interface)
1. Implement terminal UI using `GameEvent` system
2. Use mock `TerminalManager` for cross-platform testing
3. Focus on real-time feedback and component updates
4. Validate render performance against P95 <33ms target

### performance-engineer (Optimization)
1. Implement actual trait implementations in each crate
2. Replace mocks with optimized real implementations
3. Focus on cache performance (>90% hit rate) and memory usage (<50MB)
4. Validate all performance boundaries with benchmark suite
