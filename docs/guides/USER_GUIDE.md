# Centotype User Guide

> **Development Status Notice**: This user guide reflects the current implementation state of Centotype (September 28, 2025). The project has a complete foundation architecture achieving Grade A performance (22ms P99 latency), but the interactive TUI typing interface is under active development.

> **Current State**: Foundation complete - CLI command parsing works, but typing sessions currently show placeholder messages only. Full TUI implementation in progress.
