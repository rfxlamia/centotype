# Centotype Product Roadmap

## Overview
Centotype aims to deliver a precision-first CLI typing trainer with 100 progressive levels, deterministic scoring, and sub-25ms input latency. **SESSION 4 UPDATE (2025-01-27)**: Infrastructure recovery completed - compilation issues resolved and professional CLI skeleton now functional. While core architecture remains excellent, actual typing game mechanics are still in development phase.

## Implementation Status (Session 4 Recovery)
**Current Status**: HIGH-QUALITY PROJECT with FUNCTIONAL SKELETON
- **Architecture Foundation**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê EXCELLENT (sophisticated 7-crate design maintained)
- **Binary Compilation**: ‚úÖ RESTORED (warnings only, 36+ errors resolved in Session 4)
- **CLI Interface**: ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL (command parsing, help system, professional skeleton)
- **Game Mechanics**: ‚ùå PLACEHOLDER (commands execute but typing functionality not implemented)
- **Recovery Status**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS with clear path to completion

## Phase Snapshot (Corrected Status)
| Phase | Target Duration | Actual Status | Reality Check |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation** | Weeks 1-6 | ‚úÖ Infrastructure Complete / ‚ö†Ô∏è Game Mechanics Needed | ‚úÖ Professional CLI skeleton functional. ‚úÖ Compilation successful. ‚ùå Typing game logic still placeholder. READY FOR: Game mechanics implementation |
| **Phase 2 ‚Äì Content & Polish** | Weeks 7-10 | ‚úÖ Architecture Ready / ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration Pending | ‚úÖ Content system architecture excellent. ‚ö†Ô∏è Awaiting game mechanics integration for performance validation |
| **Phase 3 ‚Äì Release Preparation** | Weeks 11-12 | ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending Game Mechanics | Requires completion of actual typing trainer functionality |

## Milestone Breakdown (Status Corrected)
### Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation (Infrastructure ‚úÖ / Game Logic ‚ùå)
- **Architecture & Tooling**: Rust workspace, CI/CD, performance harnesses ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE
- **Core Engine Design**: Scoring, error classification, and keystroke pipeline ‚úÖ DESIGN EXCELLENT
- **CLI Surface Architecture**: Command orchestration, interactive UI flows ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL SKELETON
- **TUI Interface Design**: Ratatui-based interface specification ‚úÖ DESIGN COMPLETE
- **API Integration**: ‚úÖ RESTORED - Session 4 resolved compilation and interface issues
- **Exit Criteria**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY ACHIEVED - skeleton functional, game mechanics needed

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Content & Polish (Foundation ‚úÖ / Integration Needed)
- **Content Development**: 100-level corpus with difficulty formulas ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE
- **Performance Framework**: Benchmarking and validation architecture ‚úÖ FRAMEWORK READY
- **Security Framework**: Grade A audit framework and validation design ‚úÖ STANDARDS ESTABLISHED
- **Game Mechanics Integration**: ‚ùå NEEDED - connect content system to typing interface
- **Exit Criteria**: ‚ö†Ô∏è READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION - awaiting game mechanics completion

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Release Preparation (Design Ready / Implementation Blocked)
- **Distribution Architecture**: Cargo, npm, and binary artifact design ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE READY
- **Go-to-Market**: Launch messaging frameworks üîÑ DESIGN IN PROGRESS
- **Support Playbooks**: Incident runbooks and monitoring design üìù FRAMEWORK PLANNED
- **Exit Criteria**: ‚ùå BLOCKED - dependent on Phase 1 and 2 completion

## Critical Next Steps (Post Session 4)
### NEXT PRIORITY: Game Mechanics Implementation
**Issue**: CLI skeleton functional but typing game logic still placeholder
**Impact**: Commands execute successfully but immediately exit without typing functionality
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for core gameplay implementation
**Evidence**: Successful CLI compilation and command parsing confirmed

### SECONDARY: Content Integration
**Issue**: Content generation system needs integration with live typing interface
**Examples**: Real-time text delivery, difficulty progression, level advancement
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks once game mechanics foundation complete

### TERTIARY: Performance Validation
**Issue**: Cannot measure actual performance until typing functionality implemented
**Impact**: Architectural targets exist but require functional implementation for validation
**Timeline**: Continuous validation once game mechanics operational

## Development Timeline (Post Session 4)
### Immediate Actions (1-2 Weeks)
**Priority 1: Core Game Mechanics**
- Implement actual typing game loop in engine crate
- Connect ratatui terminal interface with real-time input handling
- Integrate content delivery system with live typing session
- Implement basic scoring and progress tracking

**Priority 2: Content System Integration**
- Connect 100-level content generator to live gameplay
- Implement level progression and difficulty scaling
- Add real-time performance metrics and feedback
- Validate content loading performance during live sessions

### Short-term Goals (2-4 Weeks)
**Functional Implementation**
- Complete end-to-end typing trainer functionality
- Implement all training modes (arcade, drill, endurance)
- Add live performance analytics and error tracking
- Achieve basic feature parity with design specifications

**Performance Validation**
- Measure actual P99 input latency against <25ms target
- Validate memory usage during extended sessions
- Confirm startup time and rendering performance
- Establish baseline metrics for optimization

### Medium-term Recovery (1-3 Months)
**Functionality Restoration**
- Achieve basic typing trainer functionality
- Validate performance claims through measurement
- Complete cross-platform testing
- Deliver working end-to-end experience

**Reputation Recovery**
- Demonstrate consistent delivery
- Rebuild stakeholder trust through honest communication
- Showcase technical excellence through working product
- Establish track record of verified claims

## Current Status Assessment (Session 4 - 2025-01-27)
**Session 4 Conclusion**: INFRASTRUCTURE RECOVERY SUCCESSFUL

**Achievements Confirmed**:
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Compilation Restored**: 36+ errors resolved, clean builds with warnings only
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **CLI Functionality**: Professional command parsing and help system operational
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Architecture Maintained**: Sophisticated 7-crate design preserved through recovery
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **API Integration**: Session Result interface consistency achieved across crates

**Next Development Phase**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Game Mechanics**: Core typing functionality needs implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Content Integration**: Connect generation system to live typing interface
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Validation**: Measure actual metrics once functionality complete
