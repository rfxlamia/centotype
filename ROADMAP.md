# Centotype Product Roadmap

## Overview
Centotype aims to deliver a precision-first CLI typing trainer with 100 progressive levels, deterministic scoring, and sub-25ms input latency. The project has successfully completed the Week 3-4 Integration Phase (September 28, 2025) with a fully functional typing trainer achieving Grade A performance targets. The implementation includes real-time TUI interface, engine integration, and comprehensive validation framework. **Current status: Ready for Phase 1 close-out, conditional on resolving 27+ identified panic safety violations.**

## Phase Snapshot (from PRD ¬ß11.1)
| Phase | Target Duration | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| **Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation** | Weeks 1-6 | ‚ö†Ô∏è 95% complete | ‚úÖ Architecture, scoring engine, CLI complete. ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER: 27+ panic safety violations require remediation before close-out.
| **Phase 2 ‚Äì Content & Polish** | Weeks 7-10 | ‚úÖ Content complete / ‚úÖ Performance Grade A | 100-level corpus complete; Performance optimized to Grade A (22ms P99 latency). Cross-platform validation pending.
| **Phase 3 ‚Äì Release Preparation** | Weeks 11-12 | ‚è≥ Ready pending safety fixes | Packaging and launch readiness achieved. Blocked pending panic safety violation remediation.

## Milestone Breakdown
### Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation (95% Complete)
- **Architecture & Tooling**: Rust workspace, CI/CD, performance harnesses ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Core Engine**: Scoring, error classification, and keystroke pipeline ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **CLI Surface**: Command orchestration, interactive UI flows, help UX ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Real-Time TUI**: Ratatui-based interface with live feedback ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Engine Integration**: Full typing loop with crossterm input handling ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Exit Criteria**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER - 27+ panic safety violations must be resolved before Phase 1 close-out.

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Content & Polish (Content ‚úÖ / Performance ‚úÖ)
- **Content Development**: 100-level corpus with difficulty formulas ‚úÖ COMPLETE (94% cache hit rate)
- **Performance Optimization**: Grade A achieved - 22ms P99 input latency ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Security Validation**: Grade A security audit with zero high-risk findings ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Stability & QA**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Cross-platform regression suite pending; panic safety remediation in progress
- **Exit Criteria**: Pending cross-platform validation and panic safety violation fixes.

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Release Preparation (Ready pending Phase 1 close-out)
- **Distribution**: Cargo, npm, and binary artifacts ready for packaging ‚úÖ READY
- **Go-to-Market**: Launch messaging and community onboarding materials üîÑ IN PREPARATION
- **Support Playbooks**: Incident runbooks and monitoring dashboards üìù PLANNED
- **Exit Criteria**: Blocked on Phase 1 close-out completion (panic safety fixes).

## Cross-Cutting Initiatives
- **Performance & Analytics**: ‚úÖ Analytics framework complete with Grade A performance achieved (22ms P99 latency).
- **Security & Compliance**: ‚úÖ Grade A security audit complete; cargo-audit/deny pipelines maintained; ‚ö†Ô∏è panic safety violations require remediation.
- **Documentation**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive docs/ suite with all Session 3 achievements documented and implementation status updated.
- **Content Lifecycle**: ‚úÖ Production-ready content system with 94% cache hit rate and deterministic generation.
- **Quality Framework**: ‚úÖ Code quality standards established; ‚ö†Ô∏è 27+ panic safety violations identified and documented.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Key Dependencies**: ‚úÖ Rust engineering bandwidth secured; ‚úÖ diverse terminal environments tested; ‚úÖ content QA resources allocated.
- **Primary Risks**:
  - **CRITICAL**: 27+ panic safety violations blocking production release ‚Üí Mitigation: systematic remediation in progress with comprehensive audit.
  - Input latency regression during safety fixes ‚Üí Mitigation: continuous benchmark monitoring and performance validation suite.
  - Cross-platform inconsistencies from panic fixes ‚Üí Mitigation: expanded platform test matrix and validation framework.

## Current Status (September 28, 2025)
**‚úÖ MAJOR MILESTONE**: Week 3-4 Integration Phase completed successfully
- Full typing trainer with real-time feedback implemented
- Performance targets achieved (Grade A)
- All 12 specialized subagents executed successfully
- TIER 1, 2, and 3 implementation complete
- Binary compiles and executes successfully

**‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER**: 27+ panic safety violations identified requiring systematic remediation

**üéØ NEXT STEPS**: Panic safety violation remediation with performance preservation
