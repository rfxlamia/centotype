# Centotype Product Roadmap

## Overview
Centotype aims to deliver a precision-first CLI typing trainer with 100 progressive levels, deterministic scoring, and sub-25ms input latency. **CRITICAL UPDATE (2025-01-27)**: External code review reveals significant implementation gaps. While the project demonstrates exceptional architectural quality and professional engineering standards, compilation failures and API integration issues prevent current functionality. The roadmap has been revised to reflect actual implementation status and provide realistic recovery timeline.

## Implementation Reality Check (External Assessment)
**Current Status**: HIGH-QUALITY PROJECT with ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ISSUES
- **Architecture Foundation**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê EXCELLENT (sophisticated 7-crate design, 2,267+ lines professional documentation)
- **Binary Compilation**: ‚ùå FAILED (18+ API integration errors prevent compilation)
- **Integration Status**: ‚ùå BROKEN (API interface mismatches between crates)
- **Recovery Assessment**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGHLY RECOVERABLE with "weeks to months, not years" timeline

## Phase Snapshot (Corrected Status)
| Phase | Target Duration | Actual Status | Reality Check |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation** | Weeks 1-6 | ‚ùå Architecture Complete / Integration Broken | ‚úÖ Professional architecture design. ‚ùå Binary compilation fails with 18+ errors. BLOCKERS: API mismatches, panic safety violations, test failures |
| **Phase 2 ‚Äì Content & Polish** | Weeks 7-10 | ‚úÖ Design Complete / ‚ùå Integration Required | ‚úÖ Content system architecture excellent. ‚ùå Cannot validate performance - compilation failures prevent measurement |
| **Phase 3 ‚Äì Release Preparation** | Weeks 11-12 | ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked on Phase 1 Resolution | Requires successful completion of API integration and panic safety fixes |

## Milestone Breakdown (Status Corrected)
### Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation (Architecture ‚úÖ / Integration ‚ùå)
- **Architecture & Tooling**: Rust workspace, CI/CD, performance harnesses ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE
- **Core Engine Design**: Scoring, error classification, and keystroke pipeline ‚úÖ DESIGN EXCELLENT
- **CLI Surface Architecture**: Command orchestration, interactive UI flows ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE
- **TUI Interface Design**: Ratatui-based interface specification ‚úÖ DESIGN COMPLETE
- **Engine Integration**: ‚ùå BROKEN - API interface mismatches prevent compilation
- **Exit Criteria**: ‚ùå BLOCKED - 18+ compilation errors, 27+ panic safety violations, test suite instability

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Content & Polish (Foundation ‚úÖ / Validation Impossible)
- **Content Development**: 100-level corpus with difficulty formulas ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE (design ready)
- **Performance Framework**: Benchmarking and validation architecture ‚úÖ FRAMEWORK READY
- **Security Framework**: Grade A audit framework and validation design ‚úÖ STANDARDS ESTABLISHED
- **Stability & QA**: ‚ùå CANNOT EXECUTE - compilation failures prevent testing
- **Exit Criteria**: ‚ùå BLOCKED - requires Phase 1 integration resolution

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Release Preparation (Design Ready / Implementation Blocked)
- **Distribution Architecture**: Cargo, npm, and binary artifact design ‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE READY
- **Go-to-Market**: Launch messaging frameworks üîÑ DESIGN IN PROGRESS
- **Support Playbooks**: Incident runbooks and monitoring design üìù FRAMEWORK PLANNED
- **Exit Criteria**: ‚ùå BLOCKED - dependent on Phase 1 and 2 completion

## Critical Blockers (External Assessment)
### BLOCKER 1: API Integration Failures
**Issue**: CLI ‚Üî Core interface mismatches (session_result.wpm vs session_result.metrics.wpm)
**Impact**: 18+ compilation errors prevent binary generation
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for systematic API alignment
**Evidence**: Direct compilation testing by external reviewer

### BLOCKER 2: Panic Safety Violations
**Issue**: 27+ instances in production code paths
**Examples**: ContentManager::default() panic, CLI unwrap() calls
**Locations**: performance_validator.rs:454, fs_security.rs multiple violations
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for systematic remediation

### BLOCKER 3: Test Suite Instability
**Issue**: 16/29 content tests failing, 3/34 core tests failing
**Impact**: Cannot validate functionality or performance
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for stabilization once API fixed

### BLOCKER 4: Documentation Process Issues
**Issue**: Technical docs excellent but marketing claims unverified
**Impact**: Credibility damage, stakeholder confusion
**Timeline**: 1 week for process alignment

## Recovery Timeline (External Assessment)
### Immediate Actions (1-2 Weeks)
**Priority 1: API Integration Fixes**
- Resolve CLI ‚Üî Core interface mismatches
- Fix session_result field access patterns
- Restore compilation capability
- Enable basic functionality testing

**Priority 2: Panic Safety Remediation**
- Systematic review of 27+ violations
- Replace unwrap() calls with proper error handling
- Remove ContentManager::default() panic
- Implement defensive programming patterns

### Short-term Goals (2-4 Weeks)
**Integration Stabilization**
- Restore test suite stability (>90% pass rate)
- Implement integration testing framework
- Validate cross-crate API compatibility
- Enable performance measurement and validation

**Process Alignment**
- Standardize documentation quality gates
- Implement claim verification procedures
- Align technical and marketing documentation
- Establish consistent quality standards

### Medium-term Recovery (1-3 Months)
**Functionality Restoration**
- Achieve basic typing trainer functionality
- Validate performance claims through measurement
- Complete cross-platform testing
- Deliver working end-to-end experience

**Reputation Recovery**
- Demonstrate consistent delivery
- Rebuild stakeholder trust through honest communication
- Showcase technical excellence through working product
- Establish track record of verified claims

## Current Status Assessment (2025-01-27)
**External Review Conclusion**: HIGH-QUALITY PROJECT with ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ISSUES

**Strengths Confirmed**:
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Architecture Quality**: Sophisticated 7-crate design with professional patterns
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Engineering Standards**: ADR process, comprehensive documentation, quality frameworks
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Technical Foundation**: Excellent design capable of meeting performance targets
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Recovery Potential**: "Weeks to months, not years" with clear path forward

**Critical Issues Identified**:
- ‚ùå **Integration Execution**: API mismatches prevent compilation
